# Memtech NodeBots Day!

What is a NodeBot? A robot powered by Node.js, of course! JavaScript has become a great all-purpose language that has broken out of the web browser and into servers, microcontrollers, battlebots, quadcopters, boats, rockets, and more!  One day each year, there is a worldwide celebration of JavaScript robotics, learning, and making.  

Join us on July 29 in Memphis, TN to take part in our local NodeBots Day!  We'll be making small wirelessly controlled cars, and will play a few games of robot soccer for fun and prizes :)

## Preparing for NodeBots Day

(Buy Parts)[PARTS_LIST.md]

There are many, many great NodeBot examples out there.  A simple rover is a good, fun, recognizable project that has wide appeal.  Plus, you can play soccer with them.

**Additional Materials**

* Soccer Field
* Wireless router
* Small phillips head screwdrivers
* Extra batteries and battery chargers
* Lots of volunteers

### Pre-Assembly

In order to avoid the use of soldering irons at the event itself, some pre-soldering must be done by organizers and volunteers.  

* Solder wire leads onto motors.  The yellow motors come with two detached wires. They should be soldered onto the terminals on the motors.
* Solder female header pin strip onto WeMos D1 Mini.  The D1 Mini comes with a variety of header options.  I like the short-pin female headers, as they give the chip a sturdier feel.
* Put kit elements together.  Bag up the chassis, chips, jumpers, connectors, and batteries into a single kit.
* Modify Firmaware (as per these instructions.)[https://github.com/hxlnt/feather-nodebot/wiki/1.-Setting-up-the-Feather-HUZZAH-microcontroller#user-content-setting-up-the-feather-huzzah-with-firmata-and-johnny-five]
* Install Firmware
* Connect to wireless router and note the IP address. 
* Assign a static/reserved IP address for each device.
* Note the IP of each device and label the kit bag with the IP address.


### Prepare Activities

**NodeBots Soccer**

The Field -- A 4' by 6' (actual dimensions TBD) rectangular space enclosed by 2x6 boards with slots cut out of the shorter ends for goals.


## NodeBots Day!

For NodeBots 2017 Memphis, we'll be building small rovers. The kit will be simple and solder free.  This should allow everyone to finish building the bot in less than an hour.  Some basic code to get the bot moving around will be provided to participants, and explained line-by-line to those new to coding and/or JavaScript.  Some Node.js basics (e.g. running a program and getting packages from NPM) will also be explained.  

### Tentative Schedule:

1. Welcome (15m)
1. Bot Assembly (30m - 1h)
1. Basic Code Instruction (1h)
1. Modding Controls (1h)
1. Lunch (30m - 1h)
1. Soccer Setup (30m during lunch or before event)
1. Soccer Tournament (2h - 3h)
1. Prizes (15m)
1. Clean Up

Point participants to the (ASSEMBLY.md)[ASSEMBLY.md] for instructions when on their own.
