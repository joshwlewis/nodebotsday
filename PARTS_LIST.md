The goal for this particular bot build is threefold:

1. Low-cost.  A lower cost creates less of a barrier to entry, especially for students.
1. Wireless. Because a car with a long wire attached is lame.
1. Solder-free.  Soldering is fun, but can be overwhelming for an absolute beginner.  Also, it takes a really long time if you have more people than soldering stations during an event. Best to just skip it and forcus more on the JavaScript than melting wires together.

The ESP8266 is a great chip that comes in many flavors.

All Parts (except batteries) sourced from China via AliExpress.com, but can be found domestically on eBay, Amazon, Digi-key, and other retailers for 2-3x the cost.
